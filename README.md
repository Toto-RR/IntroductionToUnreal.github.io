# Introduction To Unreal
Introduction to Unreal Engine by Toni Romanos

## About me
I'm a student at Citm, I'm 20 years old and I'm studying Game Design and Development.

In this repository I will talk about how to start with Unreal Engine facing the project towards the development of an RPG, besides giving the pros and cons of carrying out the development of a game of this genre in Unreal.

## INTRODUCTION
We'll start by talking about when and how Unreal Engine was born.

Unreal Engine was shown in 1998 by Epic Games in the video game Unreal. Although it was created for shooters, the engine has been used for several different genres due to its great portability and power.

From that point on, the engine went through several stages and versions, until it reached the current point, where the current version is Unreal Engine 5.

## GAMES MADE WITH UNREAL ENGINE
The list of videogames created with Unreal engine is very long, with great videogames such as: 
- Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice
- Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
- Tetris Effect
- Observer
- Gears of war
- Final Fantasy VII Remake
- Rocket League
- Fortnite

As you can see, RPGs are not abundant in Unreal, but there are actually quite a few RPGs created with the engine, such as: 
- Dragon Quest XI 
- Final Fantasy VII Remake
- Lost Ark
- Priston Tale 2
- Dungeon Defenders
- Drakengard 3
Among others.

## STARTING UNREAL ENGINE
Against this background, let's start Unreal Engine.

The graphics engine can be obtained completely free of charge from the Epic Games launcher or from the Unreal Engine website.

First of all, we have to decide which version we want to install, once chosen, install and start.

When we start, we will see a screen where we must indicate what we want to create, in our case, a video game.

Then we choose game, and the following window will appear:

Here we will look at several templates. We could choose any of these, but in our case the closest to the RPG genre would be the top-down one, as we could use it quickly in an Action RPG.

Once we select the template, we can choose several options of how it works, but for beginners it is recommended not to touch anything. Finally, we choose where we want to save the project and start.

Once our project has been uploaded... Congratulations! You have started your first Unreal Engine project.

Unreal Engine has several windows and can be overwhelming at first, but don't worry, it's very easy to arrange the windows as you like from the "windows" tab at the top left.

We will use the following video to learn about the different tools offered by Unreal Engine:

After this, we already have all the basics to start developing our RPG game in Unreal Engine, in addition, Unreal offers tutorials within the engine itself to learn and deepen in the most interesting sections.

## PROS AND CONS

Unreal Engine has many good things, such as:

- A wide range of development possibilities. In addition to PC, the engine supports VR, smartphones, and consoles.
- Very intuitive and visual. The interface becomes very simple once you get some practice. Its programming style is also easy to understand and helpful for those who are not very skilled in programming.
- Very powerful. You can easily see the graphic capabilities of Unreal, which are constantly increasing, especially in the latest version.
- Free. The program is free, so anyone with a PC capable of running the engine can use it. However, anyone who earns money from a creation made with Unreal Engine will need to purchase a license.

But it also has some flaws or drawbacks, such as:

- Limited assets and a small community. The Unreal Engine community is quite limited compared to other engines, which makes the asset store less accessible due to the lack of content and high prices. In summary, it's difficult to find free assets and models for your video game, so you'll have to create them yourself or pay a high price.
- Heavy projects. Even small projects can take up a significant amount of space. This doesn't have to be a disadvantage, but it's certainly something to consider.
- Difficulty with retro or 2D games. If your idea is to create a game with a retro or 2D look, you're using the wrong engine, as Unreal Engine doesn't offer a simple way to create these types of video games.

In conclusion, I believe that Unreal Engine can be a fantastic engine for everyone, with the only downside being that you will have to create and texture each asset you want to add to the game (as long as you want to create the game for free).

Therefore, I would say that Unreal is a good engine and would be suitable for use in class to create a project with it.
